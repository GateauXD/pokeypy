## ML Approach
The ML approach is still a work in progress. Based on the results the ML approach will be slower than the Hashing Approach

### Requirements 
1: Get the machine learning model from: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/kwisatzhaderach/inceptionv3-pokemon-modelweights#InceptionV3_Pokemon.h5)

## Hashing Approach
This method is complete and functional. It works pretty well aswell.

Some things that I can add:

1. Keeping track of caught pokemon
2. Catching only non-caught pokemon
3. Releasing bad pokemon
